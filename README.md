# Coq Theories

This repository contains specific Coq theories and facts that seem useful to my researches and my students' ones.

The root library is organized in such a way that the root obtains the logical name ***Karazin*** at compile time.

1. File ***_CoqProject*** contains options for **coqide**
1. File ***TypeProperties.v*** contains the Coq-definitions for distinguishing inhabited and not inhabited types, and finite and infinite types.
Also, the corresponding examples and relations between the notions are presented and grounded.
1. File ***FSM.v*** contains the theory of finite state machines
